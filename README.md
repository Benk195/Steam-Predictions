# Steam-Predictions
An attempt to predict user scores for Steam games, using existing review data.

Installation - This notebook uses the following Python libraries:
  numpy
  pandas
  matplotlib
  sklearn
  seaborn
  
This project uses only one file as its source:
  Steam.csv - Sourced from Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games

The results of this analysis were disapointingly inconclusive. However due to day-job time limitations I do not feel capable to start a new project from scratch. I do hope you appreciate the effort.
